## WebApp Description
Do you have an interest in becoming a master at analyzing and managing stocks? Have you always wanted to gain experience with the stock market and learn statistical patterns, but don't necessarily want to use REAL money? If this is the case, this web application may be perfect for you. We aim to provide users with a platform to practice buying and selling stocks or currencies using our own fake currency system, while maintaining the integrity and realism of stock market interaction. We provide access to several graphs for users to analyze and an interface to buy and sell shares, as well as a live chat room for every stock. Our fake currency system will mock several different currency conversions and give users the simulation and experience of earning and losing money. This allows users to have a realistic trading experience without incurring risk. Additional features will be implemented to keep users interested and continually learning more about the stock market.

## Key Features

### Live Graph Anaylzer and Company Information Retrieval

We will provide a visual representation of a company's stock price in the form of a graph. This will allow users to analyze statistic patterns themselves and buy and sell accordingly. We will also provide basic information on a company including their name and description.

### Live Community Chatroom

Our platform will allow users to sign up and chat with other users currently viewing the information and graph for a certain stock. It also will give users looking to buy or sell this stock, a place to discuss the possible patterns and movement of that stock. This will create a community for our users to learn and grow together.

### Mock Currencies with Live Stock Market

To give users the experience of risk-free trading, we will create a free currency system for our users to invest with. This currency will either go up or down parallel to all stock prices available. We will give users the option to decide how much money they would like to invest, where the amount of money they either gained or lost is tracked in their trade history. 


## Additional Features

### Current Stocks and Watchlist

We aim to give users an interface that recommends them stocks based on their trade history and a watchlist that they can add several stocks to, to keep track of all the companies they would like to buy or sell from.

### Trade History

We will document all user trade history, allowig them to access this data to review challenges, mistakes, and successes with their trades. This data will also be used to give users recommendations for future trades.

### Challenge of the Day: Guess Stock Increase or Decrease

To further keep users on top of their learning experience, we will give them a challenge everyday for a random company stock, in which they will guess the amount and direction a stock will go towards within 24 hours.

### Documentation, Tutorials, and Quizzes

The app will be designed to emphasize on practice, however we will provide additional tutorials and links to learn more about stock trading, as well as quizzes to test users on their ability to analyze stocks.
