## WebApp Description
Do you have an interest in becoming a master at analyzing and managing stocks? Have you always wanted to gain experience with the stock market and learn statistical patterns, but don't necessarily want to use REAL money? If this is the case, this web application may be perfect for you. We aim to provide users with a platform to practice buying and selling stocks or currencies using our own fake currency system, while maintaining the integrity and realism of stock market interaction. We provide access to several graphs for users to analyze and an interface to buy and sell shares, as well as a live chat room for every stock. Our fake currency system will mock several different currency conversions and give users the simulation and experience of earning and losing money. This allows users to have a realistic trading experience without incurring risk.
